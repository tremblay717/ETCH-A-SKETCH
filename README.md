# ETCH-A-SKETCH
In this project, we are creating browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## Requirements :
1. Creating a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
2. Creating the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
3. Setting up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through the grid like a pen would.
4. Adding a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid is removed and a new grid is generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
